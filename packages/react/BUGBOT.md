# React Package Code Review Guidelines

This file configures automated code review rules for the `packages/react` package. BugBot will apply these guidelines when reviewing changes within this package.

## Component Structure

- New components should not be added to the `experimental` folder; instead, add them to the `components` folder and use the experimentalComponent function from `@/lib/experimental.ts`

### Imports

- **NEVER** import entire React via `import * as React from "react"`
- Import only used React components and functions
- Use named imports: `import { useState, useEffect } from "react"`

### Exports

- Use **named exports** for all components
- Avoid default exports for components
- Ensure a component in `components` or `experimental` is exported in `exports.ts`

### Client Components

- Implement `'use client'` directive **only when necessary**

### Components folder organization

Each component (in folders `components` and `experimental`) should fit this organization:

- `[COMPONENTNAME]`
  - `__tests__` the components tests
  - `__stories__` the storybook files (split documents in multiple ones if needed)
  - `index.tsx` the entrypoint of the components, it should only export, not having the logic
  - `[COMPONENTNAME].tsx` the component code
  - `types.ts` The public types (reexported by `index.tsx`)
  - `internal-types.ts` types we dont want to expose
  - `hooks/` if the component has hook files (`useXXXX.ts`) should be in this folder
  - `components/` if the component have internal subcomponents should be in this folder

Ensure elements in `components/`, `internal-types.ts`, and `internal` files are not exported

- We will try to have one component per file, unless very simple subcomponents

### Components naming

- New Components name should start with `F0`. e.g. `F0Button`
- Recommend to rename the old ones starting with `F1`, `One` or without prefix
- This doesn't apply to subcomponents or private ones

### Private components

Some components like `src/components/F0Button` has some private properties, in this case the component has an internal implementation `src/components/F0Button/internal.tsx`

## Component props

- Ensure props have clear and functional meanings. e.g. `only-icon` instead of having `hide-icon` and `hide-label`
- Avoid `className` in public components (can be a private prop)
- Avoid union types like `export type Color = 'a' | 'b'| 'c'`, use:
  ```ts
  export const colors = ["a", "b", "c"] as const
  export type Color = (typeof colors)[number]
  ```
  Ensure the const is exported as well

### `src/ui/`

Ensure those components are not re-exported

## TypeScript Standards

### Type Safety

- Use **strict** TypeScript configuration
- **NEVER** use `any` or `as any` to solve type issues
- Prefer **interfaces** over types for public APIs
- Use discriminated unions for complex state
- Export component prop interfaces
- Implement proper generic constraints

### Type Definitions

- Define prop interfaces for all components
- Use proper type inference where possible
- Avoid type assertions unless absolutely necessary

## Testing Requirements

### Test Files

- Name test files with `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts`, **never** with `.spec.ts` or `.specs.ts`
- Import Vitest methods explicitly: `import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest"`
- Do **not** import `@testing-library/jest-dom`

### Test Utilities

- When using `@testing-library/react`, use `zeroRender` from `@/testing/test-utils.tsx` instead of `render`
- `zeroRender` provides mocks for context providers

### Test Coverage

- Write **Vitest** unit tests for utilities, hooks, and components
- Create **Storybook stories** for visual testing
- Include **accessibility tests** using axe-playwright
- Test component variants and edge cases
- Avoid excessive mocking; test behavior, not internals
- Always run tests to confirm changes

## Styling Guidelines

### Tailwind CSS

- Use **Tailwind CSS** with custom configuration for primary styling
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Utilize container queries where appropriate
- Leverage **shadcn/ui** components as base primitives (avoid modifications unless necessary)

### Design Tokens

- Use Tailwind theme configuration
- Follow **shadcn/ui** token conventions
- Maintain consistent spacing and color scales

### Animation Strategy

- Use CSS animations/transitions for simple interactions
- Leverage **Framer Motion** for complex animations and gestures
- Use **tailwindcss-animate** for common animation patterns

## Code Quality

### Comments

- Avoid writing comments describing "what is it"
- Comments must be rare, highlighting complex parts of the code
- Comments must answer the question "Why?"

### Performance

- Ensure proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks to prevent memory leaks
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages

### Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain proper focus management
- Test with screen readers

## Common Issues to Check

### React-Specific

- Memory leaks in components (ensure proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks)
- Missing dependency arrays in hooks
- Improper state updates (mutating state directly)
- Missing key props in lists
- Inefficient re-renders

### TypeScript-Specific

- Use of `any` type
- Missing type definitions
- Incorrect type assertions
- Unused imports or variables
- Avoid cycle imports

### Testing-Specific

- Tests should be real unit tests
- Coverage should be at least 80%
- Missing test coverage for new components
- Tests that mock too much internal implementation
- Missing accessibility tests
- Incorrect test file naming

### Styling-Specific

- Inconsistent use of design tokens
- Missing responsive breakpoints
- Hardcoded values instead of tokens
- Incorrect Tailwind class usage

## Architecture Patterns

- Use functional components
- Follow atomic design principles
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Separate concerns (presentation vs. logic)
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

## Security Considerations

- Validate user inputs in React components
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless absolutely necessary

## Storybook

- Ensure the components have at least one story file
- Ensure the story docs covers all the properties
- For properties with limited and well know options use the const array for the select values from the component. Avoid repeating the values in the story
  ```ts
  export const colors = ["a", "b", "c"] as const
  export type Color = (typeof colors)[number]
  ```
- For union types use table in argtypes:

```
 table: {
        type: {
          summary: "[The TYPE, e.g Color = 'a'| 'b'| 'c']",
        },
      }
```

- Ensure there is a story called Snapshot which includes `parameters: withSnapshot({}),` to ensure the component has visual regression tests in chromatic
  e.g.
  ```
  export const Snapshot: Story = {
      parameters: withSnapshot({}),
      render: () => (
          <div className="flex w-fit flex-col gap-2">
          <div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
              <F0AvatarDate date={exampleDate} />
          </div>
          </div>
      ),
  }
  ```
