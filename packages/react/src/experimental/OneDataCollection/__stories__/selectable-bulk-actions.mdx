# Data collection Selectable and bulk actions

## Introduction

The selectable and bulk actions are two features related (but selectable can
work without bulk actions) that allow the user to select items in the data
collection and perform actions on them.

The selectable is applied in the frontend just defining a function that returns
the id of the item to be selected in the source. This value is common for all
visualizations.

The bulk actions are applied in the frontend just defining a function that
returns the actions to be performed on the selected items.

> Important: The value returned by the selectable function must be unique for
> each datacollection

## Selectable

In order to use the selectable, you need to define a function that returns the
id of the item to be selected in the source. This value is common for all
visualizations.

> Important: The value returned by the selectable function must be unique for
> each datacollection

```tsx
const { source, currentSelectable, setCurrentSelectable } = useDataCollection({
  ...
  selectable: (item) => item.id,
  },
  ...
})

<OneDataCollection
  source={source}
  onSelectItems={handleSelectItems}
/>
```

You can react to the item selection change using the `OneDataCollection`
component `onSelectItems` prop.

### onSelectItems

The `onSelectItems` prop is a function that is called when the user selects or
de-selects an item.

The callback receives the an object with the following properties:

- `allSelected`: A boolean indicating the all items check is checked.
- `groupsStatus`: If the data is grouped, an object with the status of each
  group all checked status. e.g. `{ "group1": true, "group2": false }` (Checked
  true means the user has checked all items in the group or the all group global
  check)
- `itemsStatus`: This is an array of `{item: R, checked: boolean}` objects which
  indicates the items status. NOTE: This doesn't represent all the selected
  items, it represents the items that where loaded in the data collection and
  their status.
- `filters`: The current filters state

### defaultSelectedItems

The `defaultSelectedItems` prop is an object that contains the default selected
items.

```tsx
const { source, currentSelectable, setCurrentSelectable } = useDataCollection({
  ...
  selectable: (item) => item.id,
  defaultSelectedItems: {
    allSelected: false,
    items: [
      { id: "1", checked: true },
      { id: "2", checked: false },
    ],
    groups: [
      { groupId: "group1", checked: true },
      { groupId: "group2", checked: false },
    ],
  },
  ...
})
```

### Selection scope (page-only vs all-pages)

By default, the selection state is scoped to the current page only. This means:

- Selection state resets when navigating between pages
- `itemsStatus` only includes items from the current page
- `selectedCount` and `totalKnownItemsCount` are based on current page only
- Useful for bulk actions that should only affect the current page

If you need to maintain selection across all pages (like the backend manages the
selection), you can set `allPagesSelection: true` in your data source:

```tsx
const { source } = useDataCollectionSource({
  ...
  selectable: (item) => item.id,
  allPagesSelection: true, // Maintain selection across all pages
  ...
})
```

When `allPagesSelection` is enabled, the ActionBar will show a "Select all N items"
link after selecting all items on the current page, following the Gmail-style pattern
for cross-page selection.

**Page-only selection (default behavior):**

- Navigate to page 1, select 2 items
- Navigate to page 2 → previous selections are cleared
- Select 3 items on page 2
- Only the 3 items from page 2 are selected

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionStories.WithPageOnlySelection}
  meta={DataCollectionStories}
/>

**All-pages selection (`allPagesSelection: true`):**

- Navigate to page 1, select 2 items
- Navigate to page 2 → previous selections are maintained
- Select 3 items on page 2
- All 5 items (2 from page 1 + 3 from page 2) are selected
- When all items on a page are selected, a "Select all N items" banner appears
- You need to manage the full selection state in your backend

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionStories.WithCrossPageSelection}
  meta={DataCollectionStories}
/>

#### Examples

**Default selected items**

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionStories.WithSelectableAndDefaultSelectedItems}
  meta={DataCollectionStories}
/>

**Default selected items and groups**

<Canvas
  of={DataCollectionStories.WithSelectableAndDefaultSelectedGroups}
  meta={DataCollectionStories}
/>

#### Why this complex structure?

You can think why not just return an array of selected items?

The answer is that the data collection is a stateful component that is
responsible for fetching the data and not all the dataset is loaded from the
backend. Data collection only loads the data needed to render the view in each
moment.

Imagine this scenario:

- You have a dataset of 1000 items
- You are in the first page
- You click on the "Select all" button
- You navigate to the second page
- You select all selected because the all items check is checked
- You navigate to the third page
- You deselect the element 1,5,6 and 10 in the third page
- You want to delete the selected items

The datacollection only know the first 30 items in the dataset, so it can't
return an array of selected items.

In this case trusting only in the itemsStatus the action will not delete all the
items the user expect as there is no items loaded from the rest of pages.

This is why the `onSelectItems` callback receives more information to allow you
to recover the list of selected items in your side (typically in the backend)

In this example you know the user has checked the `allSelected` that means it
wants to delete all the items in the dataset, but from the `itemsStatus` you
know that the user unchecked the items 1,5,6 and 10 you should not remove them.

This works in the same way for the groups.

## Bulk actions

Bulk Actions allow users to select multiple items in a table and perform an
action on all of them simultaneously. This functionality significantly improves
user efficiency when working with large data sets, eliminating the need to
perform the same action repeatedly on individual items.

It includes several key elements:

1. **Main checkbox**: Located in the table header, it allows selecting or
   deselecting all visible items.
2. **Individual checkboxes**: Positioned in the first column of each row, they
   allow selecting specific items.
3. **Floating toolbar**: A dark bar that appears at the bottom of the screen
   when items are selected. It contains:
   - **Counter**: Displays the number of selected items.
   - **Available actions**: Buttons or dropdown menu representing the actions
     that can be performed on the selected items.
   - **Cancel button**: Allows deselecting all items and hiding the toolbar.

The bulk actions allows you to define a set of actions that will be available
when the user has selected items.

The data collection will render the actions in the actionbar of the data
collection and will be disabled if no items are selected.

```tsx
const { source, currentSelectable, setCurrentSelectable } = useDataCollection({
  ...
  selectable: (item) => item.id,
  bulkActions: (allSelected) => {
    return {
      primary: [
        {
          label: allSelected ? "Delete All" : "Delete",
          icon: Delete,
          id: "delete-all",
        },
        {
          label: allSelected ? "Edit All" : "Edit",
          icon: Edit,
          id: "edit-all",
        },
      ],
      secondary: [
        {
          label: "Approve",
          icon: Approve,
          id: "approve",
        },
      ],
    }
  }
  ...
})

<OneDataCollection
  source={source}
  onBulkAction={handleBulkActions}
/>
```

You can react to the action selected by the user using the `OneDataCollection`
component `onBulkAction` prop.

### datasource.bulkActions

Defined the available actions in the data source via a function that get the
selected items (in the same way as the `onSelectItems` callback). This allows
you to define the actions based on the selected items.

It returns an object with the following properties:

- `primary`: A mandatory array of primary actions. If more than one action is
  defined, the data collection will render a dropdown button with the actions.
- `secondary`: An optional array of secondary actions.

```tsx
  bulkActions?: (
    selectedItems: Parameters<OnBulkActionCallback<Record, Filters>>[1]
  ) => {
    primary: BulkActionDefinition[]
    secondary?: BulkActionDefinition[]
  }
```

#### BulkActionDefinition

- `label: string`: The label to show in the button / dropdown
- `icon?: IconType`: The icon to show in the button / dropdown
- `id: string`: The id of the action. This is used to identify the action in the
  `onBulkAction` callback.
- `keepSelection?: boolean`: If true, the selection will not be cleared after
  the action is performed (false by default)

### onBulkAction

The `onBulkAction` prop is a function that is called when the user selects an
action.

The callback receives the following parameters:

- `action`: The action selected by the user
- `selectedItems`: The items selected by the user. Check the `onSelectItems`
  callback for more information about the structure of the object.
