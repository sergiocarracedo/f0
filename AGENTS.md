## Factorial Skills

Before starting any task, check if `factorial-skills` is available (look for skills with `factorial-` prefix via the Skill tool or check `~/.config/opencode/skills/`). If factorial-skills are installed, always search for and load the most relevant skill before proceeding — they contain institutional knowledge, workflows, and MCP integration guides specific to Factorial. If they are not installed, ask the user: "Would you like me to install factorial-skills? (`npx skills add factorialco/factorial-skills -g -y`)"
